title: Integrating and reporting full multi-view supervised learning experiments using
  SuMMIT
booktitle: 'Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Learning with Imbalanced
  Domains: Theory and Applications (LIDTA 2022)'
abstract: SuMMIT (Supervised Multi Modal Integration Tool) is a software offering many functionalities for running, tuning, and analyzing experiments of supervised classification tasks specifically designed for multi-view data sets. SuMMIT is part of a platform that aggregates multiple tools to deal with multiview datasets such as scikit-multimodallearn (Benielli et al., 2021) or MAGE (Bauvin et al., 2021). This paper presents use cases of SuMMIT, including hyper-parameters optimization, demonstrating the usefulness of such a platform for dealing with the complexity of multi-view benchmarking on an imbalanced dataset. SuMMIT is powered by Python3 and based on scikit-learn, making it easy to use and extend by plugging one's own specific algorithms, score functions or adding new features. By using continuous integration, we encourage collaborative development.
