abstract: Purpose: This work proposes the hypothesis that data oversampling may lead to dataset simplification according to selected data difficulty metrics and that such simplification positively affects the quality of selected classifier learning methods.
Methods: A set of computer experiments was performed for 47 benchmark datasets to make the hypothesis plausible. The experiments considered five oversampling methods, five classifiers, and 22 metrics for data difficulty assessment. The experiments aim to establish: (a) whether there is a relationship between resampling and change in the difficulty of the training data and (b) whether there is a relationship between changes in the values of training set difficulty metrics and classification quality. 
Results: Based on the obtained results, the research hypothesis was confirmed. It was indicated which measures correlate with selected classifiers. The experiments showed the relationship between the change of assessed difficulty measures after oversampling and the classification quality of selected models.
Conclusion: The obtained results allow using the selected measures to predict whether a given oversampling method leads to favorable modifications of the learning set for a given type of classifier. Showed relationship between difficulty measures and classification will allow using the mentioned measures as a learning criterion. For example, guided oversampling can treat the modification of the learning set as an optimization task. During the oversampling process, no estimation of classification quality metrics will be required, but only an evaluation of the training set difficulty. This may contribute to the proposition of computationally efficient methods.
