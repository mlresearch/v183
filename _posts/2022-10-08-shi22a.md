title: Improving Imbalanced Learning by Pre-finetuning with Data Augmentation
booktitle: 'Proceedings of the Fourth International Workshop on Learning with Imbalanced
  Domains: Theory and Applications (LIDTA 2022)'
abstract: Imbalanced data is ubiquitous in the real world, where there is an uneven distribution of classes in the datasets. Such class imbalance poses a major challenge for modern deep learning, even with the typical class-balanced approaches such as re-sampling and re-weighting. In this work, we introduced a simple training strategy, namely pre-finetuning, as a new intermediate training stage in between the pretrained model and finetuning. We leveraged the idea of data augmentation to learn an initial representation that better fits the imbalanced distribution of the domain task during the pre-finetuning stage. We tested our method on manually contrived imbalanced datasets (both two-class and multi-class) and the FDA drug labeling dataset for ADME (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) classification. We found that, compared with standard single-stage training (i.e., vanilla finetuning), our method consistently attains improved model performance by large margins. Our work demonstrated that pre-finetuning is a simple, yet effective, learning strategy for imbalanced data.
