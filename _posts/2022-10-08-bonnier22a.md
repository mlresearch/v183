  Distributions

abstract: 'Ordinal classification aims to categorize instances into ordered classes. An underrated or overrated prediction can have significant impacts in applications such as credit rating. Ordinal approaches based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can be employed to capture nonlinear patterns. However, under conditions such as lack of training data, their generalization power can be adversely impacted. In this paper, we propose to experimentally assess the robustness of various ordinal classifiers, with a focus on risk rating tasks. We suggest two types of scenarios to evaluate robustness in Machine Learning: lack of training data and data distribution shift. We also propose the ordinal classifier chains, an extension of the multi-label classifier chains to ordinal tasks. It uses a lightweight bit layout to encode the labels and employs the chain of classifiers to form a connected structure. Using various evaluation metrics, we compare a selection of ML models under different robustness tests. The models are evaluated on a specific risk rating dataset with significant class imbalance. This benchmark offers a picture of which ML models might be more robust in various data contexts.'
