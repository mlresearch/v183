abstract: Propensity weighting enables learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning) in the face of labeling bias. PU learning aims to train a binary classification model when only positive and unlabeled data is available to learn from. This problem setting arises commonly in practice. Often, PU data suffers from a labeling bias, where the labeled examples are a biased sample from the positive examples. The probability for a positive example to get selected to be labeled is called its propensity score. Weighting PU datasets using propensity scores, allows to learn an unbiased model from biased PU data. However, this method has a strong downside of being rather unstable. This paper proposes a robust method for learning from biased PU data based on bagging. We show that the proposed method remains unbiased, while it reduces the variance and hence increases robustness. Our experiments confirms this by showing that our method has lower variance and classification error than plain propensity weighting as well as another method that was proposed for variance reduction.
